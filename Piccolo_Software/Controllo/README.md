# Controllo
----------------
Controllo is a standalone program that runs on your, pc , mac or linux machine. That lets you send your own SVG vector artworks or a series of pre-defined generative artworks to your Piccolo for drawing.


Your Piccolo will need to have the usbTether firmware installed and be attached to your computer in order to communicate with Controllo. The usbTether program can be found in [PiccoloLib](https://github.com/DiatomStudio/Piccolo/tree/master/PiccoloLib) under examples.
