## Plotsi

Plotsi is a series of earlier Piccolo designs that started as 3d printed parts and changed to be laser cut.
Rather than the X > Y > Z configuration of the Telaio and Piccolo v1 versions, the Plotsi designs put the Y axis mounted on Z axis, ie: X > Z > Y.

### Plotsi v1

Early concept block-model looking at the dimensions of submicro servos and range of motion.  A speculative "cnc shield" for an arduino.  Not a working model, but could be with a bit of work.

### Plotsi v2

3D printable prototype, printed on on a makerbot cupcake cnc and with cheap generic analog servos (towerpro sg50-like).  Has a small 25x25x25mm output envelope.

### Plotsi v3

3D printable, also prototyped on a cupcake cnc but with less cheap emax digital ES08D servos.  Has a small 25x25x25mm output envelope.  Considerably larger with an output envelope of around 50x50x30mm roughly.

Used for an [installation at Tangíveis Resiência AZ](http://blog.diatom.cc/piccolo/piccolo-prototype-plotsi-at-tangiveis-residencia) in 2012, together with Teresa Cardoso.

### Plotsi v4

Laser cut design published with the initial launch of [](www.piccolo.cc).  Uses the same emax servos and has a larger 65x65x30mm output envelope.  This was our first widely prototyped Piccolo version.
