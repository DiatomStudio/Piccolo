## Telaio

Telaio ("frame") follows an X > Y > Z configuration that stacks the X and Y gears on top of each other.  This is the strategy that led to the Piccolo v1 design.

### Telaio v0 / v1 / v2

These initial prototypes/concepts started with just the X/Y axis to create a simple servo-driven plotter.  The first was prototyped on a papercutter, the second was laser-cut.

### Telaio v3 / v4

Laser-cut iterations using emax ES08D digital servos.

### Telaio v5

Smaller/more resolved laser-cut version, still using the ES08D servos.  The smallest of all our piccolo designs, but with an output envelope of about 60x60x40mm.

This design was used at our first piccolo workshop at the [LiWoLi 2012 festival in Linz](http://blog.diatom.cc/piccolo/build-your-own-piccolo-workshop-at-linz).  In the archive there are two versions of the design, one using M2 cap screws and one using more common, M3 ones.  As with Piccolo v1, we reccomend using a combination of MDF and acrylic as shown in the photo to help reduce friction.

### Telaio v6

Laser-cut iteration that is a scaled-up version of v5 and using Corona DS-929MG servos.  We also integrated a Sparkfun Pro Micro into the base with a small protoboard for hooking up the servos, creating a 'stand-alone' design.  The output envelope is similar to the v5, about 60x60x45mm.

We used this design at our make-your-own-piccolo workshop at TEI 2013 in Barcelona.
